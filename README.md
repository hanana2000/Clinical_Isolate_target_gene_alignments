# Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Target Gene Alignment 

This repository is for a project looking for and aligning known phage target genes (pili, efflux, and porins) from PAO1 and PA14 in 39 Pseudomonas clinical isolates. 


This diagram depicts the logic for determining top hits for each target protein in each clinical isolate:
